   *    (v2.0.x+) defaults to using OpenAI's Responses API which assigns unique
   *    itemIds and reasoningEncryptedContent to message parts. When persisted

   *    200KB+ payloads in `input` and `output`. These are truncated since the
   *    model has already consumed the results.
   *
   * 3. **Filter truly empty reasoning parts**: After stripping, reasoning parts
   *    with no text and no remaining providerMetadata are removed. Parts that
   *    still carry providerMetadata (e.g. Anthropic's redacted_thinking blocks
   *    with providerMetadata.anthropic.redactedData) are preserved, as they
   *    contain data required for round-tripping with the provider API.
   *
   * 4. **User hook**: Calls the overridable `sanitizeMessageForPersistence()`
